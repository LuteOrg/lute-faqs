<p>If you need help with Python, pip, or Docker, the first and best place to look is Google!</p>
<p>But if it's a Lute issue or question, the best places to ask for help are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://discord.gg/CzFUQP5m8u">Lute Discord</a> "issues and bugs" channel.</li>
<li>Lute v3 <a href="https://github.com/luteorg/lute-v3/issues">GitHub Issues</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When coming in with a question, please be as specific with your details as possible.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Lute can be run anywhere that has the necessary requirements (Python, etc).  For a server installation, Docker would probably be the easiest.</p>
<p>It's outside of the scope of this manual to show how to set up your server in AWS, Digital Ocean, or wherever, but it's totally possible.</p>
<p>The biggest thing you probably have to worry about is your backup and disaster recovery plan.  Lute writes disk for the database and images, so make sure you're backing up and exporting to some secure, reliable location.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="can-i-run-lute-on-my-phone-or-pad"><a class="header" href="#can-i-run-lute-on-my-phone-or-pad">Can I run Lute on my phone or pad?</a></h1>
<p>Lute doesn't have a dedicated mobile offline client.  It needs a server to run the backend python code.</p>
<p>You can still use Lute on your iPhone/iPad/whatever, though.</p>
<p>One option is to set up a <a href="setup/./web-server.html">web server</a> somewhere in the cloud, and access that.  (That might be tricky, I won't be able to help with that.)</p>
<p>If your computer is running Lute, and it's on a Wifi network, you should be able to access it if your phone is on that same network:</p>
<ul>
<li>start Lute.  It will say something like <code>Lute is running.  Open a web browser, and go to: http://localhost:5001</code>.  The last 4 digits are the port number.</li>
<li>make a note of your computer's IP address (somewhere in your computer settings ... it might be something like <code>192.168.1.10</code>, or <code>10.0.0.126</code>.</li>
<li>in your phone/tablet/whatever, connect to the same Wifi network, start up the browser, and go to <code>http://&lt;the-ip-address&gt;:&lt;port-number&gt;</code>.  E.g., on my phone, it was <code>http://10.0.0.126:9876</code>, because I run my Lute on port 9876.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that your computer has to be running (not asleep), and Lute has to be running!  :-P</p>

<p>If you regularly switch between computers, one option for setup (which sounds dicey to me :-) ) is to store your data in a USB key.</p>
<h2 id="pip"><a class="header" href="#pip">Pip</a></h2>
<p>For pip users, you could custom config.yml file, and put it in the root folder where you run Lute, with something like the following:</p>
<pre><code># File config.yml
ENV: prod
DBNAME: lute.db
DATAPATH: /full/path/to/your/usb/lute/folder
BACKUP_PATH: /full/path/to/backup/folder
</code></pre>
<p>When Lute runs, it uses this config file, and will write all of its data in the folder specified in the DATAPATH.</p>
<h2 id="docker"><a class="header" href="#docker">Docker</a></h2>
<p>Docker users should change their docker-compose.yml to map the USB key folder to the mounted /lute/data directory.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="can-i-deploy-lute-on-nixos"><a class="header" href="#can-i-deploy-lute-on-nixos">Can I deploy Lute on NixOS?</a></h1>
<p>Deploy Lute on NixOS in three simple steps using <a href="https://github.com/aksiksi/compose2nix">compose2nix</a>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="can-i-make-lute-secure"><a class="header" href="#can-i-make-lute-secure">Can I make Lute secure?</a></h1>
<p>Lute doesn't come with authentication, so if you want to add security, the easiest way to do that is with a server that acts as a gatekeeper to the app (a reverse proxy).  The easiest way to do this is with Docker compose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below is a working example using an nginx reverse proxy that may be useful as a starting point.  One caveat which I haven't bothered investigating further: the session doesn't expire (quickly?), so once you log in, anyone using your same browser will have access.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This uses the same <code>lute3</code> image, but doesn't expose the port</li>
<li>The <code>nginx.conf</code> and <code>.htpasswd</code> files will exist in the same folder as this compose file; they're created below</li>
<li>This maps host port 5001 to the nginx port 80, so the message <code>http://localhost:5001</code> when you run <code>docker compose up</code> is still valid :-P</li>

<p>It's called <a href="https://www.lingq.com/">LingQ</a>. :-)</p>
<p>LingQ is great.  Pay a nominal fee and you get tons of content and a big community of users.  LingQ is also a business, so they have staff, and (hopefully) proper tech support.</p>
<p>Lute will never be online in the way that LingQ is.  While it's possible to build an online company with various cloud providers (AWS, Google, Digital Ocean, etc), running a <em>proper</em> company with <em>unbreakable confidence</em> requires a great deal of ongoing work:</p>
<ul>
<li>scalability</li>
<li>monitoring and alerting</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>backup and restore</li>
<li>disaster recovery</li>
<li>... etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than try to go online and compete with existing solutions, Lute opts to emulate the Anki desktop approach: individual user app installs.</p>

<h2 id="database-and-images"><a class="header" href="#database-and-images">Database and images</a></h2>
<p>If you're already using Lute v2 (written in PHP), and want to migrate to v3, it's pretty straightforward: you just have to move some files around.</p>
<p>Step 1. <a href="setup/../install/install.html">install Lute v3</a>, and start it up.  Then:</p>
<h3 id="for-non-docker-users"><a class="header" href="#for-non-docker-users">For non-Docker users</a></h3>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the top right corner of the home screen, click About &gt; Version and software info</li>
<li>The "Data path" folder is where you should put your database and images, replacing the files that Lute v3 automatically put there.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Lute v3</strong></li>
<li>Replace the files that Lute created in the "Data path" folder with your files.</li>
<li>Start Lute up again.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="for-docker-users"><a class="header" href="#for-docker-users">For Docker users</a></h3>
<p>It's even easier: when you started Lute v3, you had to mount some directories to the container.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Shut down Lute v3!</li>
<li>Put your database and image folder in the folder that you mounted to the <code>/lute_data</code> directory, replacing the files that Lute created there.</li>
<li>Start Lute up again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="backup-settings"><a class="header" href="#backup-settings">Backup settings</a></h2>
<p>Lute v2 has backup settings stored in the <code>.env</code> file.  v3 uses a Settings screen. The mapping of values from the <code>.env</code> file is obvious.</p>
<h2 id="custom-styles"><a class="header" href="#custom-styles">Custom styles</a></h2>
<p>Lute v2 uses a "custom_styles.css" file in the data folder.  v3 uses a Setting text box, so copy any content from your custom_styles.css file into Lute v3 Settings.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="can-you-add-language-x"><a class="header" href="#can-you-add-language-x">Can you add language X?</a></h1>
<p>Yes, but you'll need to <strong>get it working in your own Lute first</strong>.</p>

<p>Lute uses an open source epub parser named <code>openepub</code> kindly created by a Lute user to avoid licensing issues with currently available epub parsers.</p>
<p>The parser project is on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/sakolkar/openepub">https://github.com/sakolkar/openepub</a>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Parsing is always a challenge, and some epubs may contain strange formatting that the library can't handle.  If your epub doesn't parse correctly, please open a GitHub issue in the <code>openepub</code> repo.</p>
<p>In the meantime, use any of the tools available to convert your epub to a text file for import, such as <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.</p>

<p>Lute uses the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/">PyPDF2</a> library for PDF imports.</p>
<p>PDF imports sometimes add extra unwanted spaces: for example, the word "happiness" in your PDF may be imported as "happi ness".  For this reason, when you import your PDF, Lute will give you a warning that it may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>This issue is not a problem with Lute, or even with the PyPDF2 library ... correctly parsing PDFs is actually <em>extremely</em> tough.  Per the authors of PyPDF2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting whitespaces right is notoriously hard. @pubpub-zz is the expert in that topic; I'll leave it to him to decide if we should leave this issue open. The issue is that PDF does not (necessarily) represent the words as words internally. In the worst case, it just gives the absolute position of each character in the document.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/1507">Random whitespaces are inserted when using page.extract_text()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the best that we can do is say that PDF imports are not perfect, and you should be aware of that while reading.  You can edit each page as you come across problems, or just ignore the incorrect words.</p>

<p>Though Lute was developed primarily for desktop use, some users connect to Lute on their mobile devices (see <a href="reading/../setup/mobile-support.html">Mobile support</a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/usage/reading-on-mobile.html">Reading on mobile</a>).  Lute tries to set up a desktop or mobile environment automatically, but sometimes it's hard to determine if you're on mobile or not[^1].  Sometimes it's not even possible: for example, you may have a regular laptop with an additional external touchscreen ...</p>
<p>If your reading screen isn't responding to clicks or touches, you may need to tell Lute what kinds of screen interactions you need.  In the slideout menu of the reading menu, you can do that:</p>
<img width="285" alt="image" src="reading/../assets/reading/screen_interactions.png">

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-cant-i-change-a-term"><a class="header" href="#why-cant-i-change-a-term">Why can't I change a Term?</a></h1>
<p>Lute won't let you change a Term's actual text once it has been created and saved, you can only change the case of existing characters.  For example, you could change "CAT" to "Cat" or "cat", but not to "dog".</p>
<p>Allowing Terms themselves to be changed once created creates potential problems, so (for now) Lute just disables that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As I get more experience with this feature of Lute, I may do away with this restriction.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reasons for this restriction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a typo or other mistake would cause previously entered information to get accidentally overwritten.  For example, if you'd created a Spanish Term and translation "chico / boy", and then accidentally edited another existing term "CHICA / girl" to "chic<strong>o</strong> / girl" (accidentally hitting "o" instead of "a") and saved it, the existing "chico / boy" term would be updated instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During reading, if you click on an unknown word, and decide to change the term's capitalization, Lute won't let you mis-type the word.  For example, if you're reading a shocking Spanish newspaper article about "GATOS SALVAJES" (wild cats!), you might want to save the term "GATOS", but as lowercase "gatos".  Lute stops you from typing "gattos" during the fix, so the new term is created correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="where-are-my-new-terms-sentences"><a class="header" href="#where-are-my-new-terms-sentences">Where are my new Term's sentences?</a></h1>
<p>Lute shows sentences for a Term and its siblings when you click the Sentences link on the Term form, but it only includes sentences for pages marked as "read".  Pages are marked as "read" when you click either of the links at the bottom of the reading page:</p>
<img width="285" alt="image" src="terms/../assets/terms/sentences_marked_read.png">
<p>(The green checkmark also changes all unknown terms to well-known.)</p>
<p>Lute only includes sentences from pages marked "read" for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only sentences you've seen before are included, so you'll have had some exposure to the vocabulary already.  Including unread sentences would possibly show you new, confusing, or distracting vocabulary or ideas.</li>
<li>Showing unread sentences can spoil books!  (I was reading a book and when I looked up a sentence I found out that a character died ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, when you first create a new term, the Sentences link won't show any sentences right away, but once you mark the page as "read" the sentences will be shown in the future.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-should-i-use-statuses"><a class="header" href="#how-should-i-use-statuses">How should I use statuses?</a></h1>
<p>Lute has statuses 1 through 5, plus Well-Known, and Ignored.  For some people, including me sometimes, that's a lot of statuses!  Your usage of these values is totally up to you, so pick your own rating scheme and stick with it.</p>
<p>For me personally, as a longtime user of Lute, I'll say that beyond a certain point, statuses don't really matter much, except perhaps to filter later in the Term listing screen.  I use the following levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 for brand new or tricky things</li>
<li>3 for stuff I've seen before</li>
<li>5 for stuff I know well</li>
<li>Well-Known for things that occur so frequently that I don't need to look them up</li>
<li>Ignore for things like names, locations, or really specialized terms that I'm certain I'll never see again, like chemical compounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Others have more nuanced levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Defined and seen at least once before, but unlikely to understand and no attempt has been made at truly understanding/memorizing</li>
<li>2: At some point I have somewhat memorized this or understood it within context. 50% chance I will remember it if I sit and think about it for a bit, but its somewhat straining.</li>
<li>3: I can recognize this word fairly quickly and understand it. Every now and again I will have to stop and think about it for a a moment.</li>
<li>4: I recognize it and I'm comfortable with it. I've seen it semi-frequently and I'd probably remember it even if I didn't see it for a while.</li>
<li>5: Instant recall, and there's almost no chance that I'll forget this word any time soon. It should probably be WKn but I like the way green looks and makes me feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still others just use status 1-3.</p>
<p>So, pick whatever you feel is best, don't sweat it too much, and just start reading.  You can always revise term statuses as you go.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-are-term-parents"><a class="header" href="#what-are-term-parents">What are Term parents?</a></h1>
<p>"Term parents" are a way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>simplify your Term data management in Lute.</li>
<li>help you build your own "mental map" of whatever language you're studying.</li>
</ul>
<p>When reading English in Lute, you might see words like <em>break</em>, <em>broke</em>, and <em>broken</em>.  These are all different forms of the word <em>break</em>.  You can enter in "break" as the parent, track basic data there, like an image and definition, and that's used for popups etc. while reading.  You don't have to enter the same data for all the "child terms" -- that would be tedious.</p>
<p>Sometimes, parents are useful to indicate very strong relationships between words as well.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"kitten" - "cat"</li>
<li>"gatito" - "gato" (Spanish)</li>
<li>"Krankenhaus" - "krank" and "Haus" (German)</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases one "parent term" might refer to conjugations (<em>break</em> to <em>broken</em>), as well as other obvious joins (<em>break</em> to <em>unbreakable</em>).</p>
<h2 id="why-call-it-a-parent-and-not-a-lemma-or-root-form"><a class="header" href="#why-call-it-a-parent-and-not-a-lemma-or-root-form">Why call it a "parent", and not a "lemma" or "root form"?</a></h2>
<p>Good question.  From the above example, "break" is referred to as the "lemma" - aka the "canonical form", or "dictionary form"[^1].  But to me, that doesn't quite fit how my mind organizes the language -- with multiple parents and word families.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-should-i-use-this"><a class="header" href="#so-how-should-i-use-this">So, how should I use this?</a></h2>
<p>There are no hard-and-fast rules.  I mainly use "parent terms" for conjugations, and then I add in extra information if needed.</p>
<p>For example, as a basic German learner, I might have:</p>
<ul>
<li>gehen - to go (parent term)
<ul>
<li>ging, with tag "past"</li>
<li>gegangen, with tag "participle"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a more advanced Spanish learner, I add the dozens of Spanish verb forms (quiero, quise, qerría, quisiera ...) as child terms of the root, and I sometimes link words I feel belong together, just for fun (e.g., "ternura" is a child term of "tierno").</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-is-development-work-prioritized"><a class="header" href="#how-is-development-work-prioritized">How is development work prioritized?</a></h1>
<p><em>Variations on this:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>where's the roadmap?</li>
<li>what's the long-term plan?</li>
<li>can you add feature X?</li>
<li>why was feature Y added before feature Z?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all great questions, and at the moment there's really not a good answer in the normal "product" sense.</p>
<p>The goal is for Lute, or something a lot like it, to become a default viable tool for a large user base.  At the moment, the steps for getting there are not planned or roadmapped like a regular product would be: good planning takes a lot of time and energy.  Lute's free and open source, so I and others work on it as we can<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#testing">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Lute's got a big backlog of issues and ideas.  You may be wondering why your small request has been sitting in the queue since like <em>forever</em>.  There are some criteria I use to pick what to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relative size of work:</strong> how fast/easy it is to design, code, test, and document.  Sometimes small-seeming things aren't feasible.  E.g., "Couldn't you just query the database and tell me how many unknown words are in my book?"  No, unfortunately, because of the way that Lute stores data.  (It seems like it would be easy, right?  But it's not.)  Some requests are intertwined with others, or fundamentally don't follow Lute's technical design.  All good, but big changes take time.</li>
<li><strong>User impact:</strong> when I was coding just for me, this was easy.  But now with many users, I try to take that into account.</li>
<li><strong>Fun and usefulness for me personally:</strong> This keeps me motivated, and ensures that Lute doesn't have any obvious jankiness.</li>
<li><strong>Code and architecture quality:</strong> Since Lute should be open source and hackable, it should be clear.  Though I've tried to keep things sane, in some places it's tough.  So this kind of work (refactoring: improving the quality of existing code) is important.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiators:</strong> there are a few things that could make a big difference to learning.  With Lute, term images and parent terms were two of the initial things that drove me to write it in the first place.  I think that there are others as well: "word families", "sentence notes", and of course AI integration ... all of these might just be personal projects and thoughts though, I'm not sure!</li>
</ul>
<p>Lute's open source, so anyone is welcome to make forks and tweak it for their own learning and fun.  But most of us want to just <em>get on with it</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="testing"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>"Work on it as we can" sounds chaotic.  To counteract this chaos, Lute has a decent set of automated tests and checks to ensure that the code is viable.</p>

<p>You can import data into Lute via <a href="../usage/terms/bulk-term-import.html">bulk term import</a>, you just have to get your data into .csv file format.</p>
<h2 id="importing-data-from-lwt"><a class="header" href="#importing-data-from-lwt">Importing data from LWT</a></h2>
<p>LWT has an "export" feature:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/import_from_lwt.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Use "Export ALL Terms (TSV)" to export a tab-separated value file.  The file may get downloaded as a ".txt" file, in which case, rename it to ".tsv".</p>
<p>A sample row of data exported from LWT looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>gato	cat	Tengo un {gato}		1	Spanish	20
</code></pre>
<p>You can then import that file into something like <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/">Google Sheets</a>, and prepare it for import.</p>
<p>As the <a href="../usage/terms/bulk-term-import.html">bulk term import</a> page says:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line of the CSV file must have the field headings: language, term</li>
<li>The first line of the CSV file may also have any of these headings: translation, parent, status, tags, pronunciation</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a blank line, and then place Lute headings in the appropriate columns.  Continuing with the above example, the data becomes:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>term</th><th>translation</th><th>n/a</th><th>n/a</th><th>status</th><th>language</th><th>n/a</th><th>tags</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>gato</td><td>cat</td><td>Tengo un {gato}</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>Spanish</td><td>20</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Removing the unmapped columns (with "n/a" in the heading) gives:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>term</th><th>translation</th><th>status</th><th>language</th><th>tags</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>gato</td><td>cat</td><td>1</td><td>Spanish</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Export this to a .csv file, and import it into Lute.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-doesnt-lute-have-flashcards-or-an-srs"><a class="header" href="#why-doesnt-lute-have-flashcards-or-an-srs">Why doesn't Lute have flashcards, or an SRS?</a></h1>
<p>I do feel that SRS<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> plays an important role in language learning (if you like using SRS!).</p>
<p>Lute currently doesn't have a "testing" mode or SRS for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The core feature of Lute is reading, so I have been focused on making reading and parsing the most pleasant experience.  To me, testing is sort of outside of this.</li>
<li>Adding a satisfying testing experience is tricky, and could explode into a ton of work.  Anything else feels half-baked.  Here are some things I'd want to see in testing:
<ul>
<li>Efficiently testing terms and parent terms (there's no need to test each instance of every word, in my opinion) -- how to manage this best?</li>
<li>Testing for recall by image</li>
<li>Selecting terms to test</li>
<li>Testing by "category"</li>
<li>... etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather keep Lute focused on reading, and delegate testing to something that is dedicated to that -- like Anki.  There is an issue for <a href="https://github.com/luteorg/lute-v3/issues/3">Anki export</a>.  Then there would need to be a feedback loop for statuses to get updated, etc.</p>
<p>Lute is open-sourced software, though, so if someone feels a burning need to implement an SRS in Lute, they are welcome to do it.  For it to be included in the main Lute package, the code would need to pass the various quality checks, and would also need to have sufficient testing and documentation (user docs and technical docs).  It could also be written as a standalone app that interfaces with the Lute database, or perhaps via an API.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Spaced Repetition Software</p>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-is-this-free"><a class="header" href="#why-is-this-free">Why is this free?</a></h1>
<p>Lute is and will always remain free for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reciprocity.  When I've studied languages, I've had the great benefit of finding top-notch free technology and content from many, many people and organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom from accountability!  Yep, I said that.  While I would appreciate any kind of voluntary donation you might wish to give me for making Lute, I can't ask for payment.  Lute is open source software, and as such will always be a work-in-progress, no matter how great it is.  Requiring payment for use would create an additional burden of responsibility towards each user, and potentially cause frustration for users who buy something that doesn't quite work for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anki does it, why can't Lute?  Anki is miraculously free.  They have a great system, central server syncing, a massive community ... it's something to aspire to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who knows, maybe at some point Lute will become financially rewarding.  That would be a happy accident, but that's not the main goal.</p>
